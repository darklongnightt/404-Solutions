Order many times. However this batch seen like not too fresh, and had kept for week. 
Taste acceptable but a bit overprice.
Not as nice as before.
It definitely spoiled and had a very strange smell
Terrible taste
Received message at 2pm saying the dumpling would arrive between 4pm - 5pm. However, it came before 3pm. I almost missed the delivery :(
Repeat purchase. Buy when price is lower.
Very late delivery.
delivery came more than 1hr late; supposed to come at 12-5pm but came after 7.30pm.
Delivery late for 1 hr, still quite ok.
Delivery was late for 2 hours. The status shown as DELIVERED at 12pm, but nothing was delivered till 2PM.

Delivery ok, but seems overcharged for shipping
